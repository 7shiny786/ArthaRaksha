 **  This is very likely a fraud call.** 

Here's why:

  * **They asked for sensitive information:**  A legitimate bank representative would **never  ** ask for your full debit card number, expiry date, or CVV (the three digits on the back) over the phone. 
* **They   provided account details:** While they didn't explicitly ask for confirmation of the account number, providing it unsolicited is a tactic to gain trust and make you think they  're legitimate.
* **The OTP confirmation is suspicious:**  While banks use OTPs, asking you to confirm consent to use your *old* card after providing an OTP is nonsensical and a red flag.

**What to   do:**

* **Do not provide any further information.**
* **Hang up immediately.**
* **Contact your bank:** Use the official phone number on the back of your card or on your bank's website to verify if they   attempted to contact you. Report the fraudulent call. 

**Remember:** Banks will never ask for sensitive information like your full card details or CVV over the phone. Be cautious and always verify directly with your bank if you receive suspicious calls.
