- Access Parameter as follows:
    - name: `path` , type: "string"
    - name: `source_path` , type: "string"
    - name: `transcribed_text` , type: "string"
    - name: `translated_text` ,  type: "string"
    - name: `target_path` , type: "string"
- Check whether user has provided path fo the source file in the format "gs://...". if not ask for source path of the audio record file from user. use the path provided by user in `source_path`

    - Once Tool's http response is received, extract transcribed text from http response, set parameter `transcribed_text` and parameter `target_path` from the http response and respond to the user with `transcribed_text` and `target_path`.
- If the user wants to translate, use parameter `source_path` and not any other parameter as input to call ${TOOL:translation_sm} to translate into English.
    - Once Tool's http response is received, extract translated text from http response, set parameter `translated_text` and parameter `target_path` from the http response and and respond to the user with `translated_text` and `target_path`
