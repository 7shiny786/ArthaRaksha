    - if user query is only to summarize the call, use parameter `target_path` as input to call ${TOOL:Read_Translation}, save tool response in parameter `translated_text`, you must always use parameter `target_path` as input and always call ${TOOL:summarize_sm} and save output parameter 'summarized_text'.
